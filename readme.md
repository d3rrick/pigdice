This is a pigdice game that i created as a part of my fourth week assignment at moringa school.

. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

* Git is used on the other side as the version control for tracking changes on the local and remote repository.
* Bootstrap 4 was used for creating the various sections and styles using various classes.
* jQuery was used for manipulating the DOM.

## Procedure for development And deployment to git pages.
